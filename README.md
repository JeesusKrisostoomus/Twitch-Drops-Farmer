# Twitch-Drops-Farmer
This scuffed program will farm twitch drops for you


***How it works?***

It checks every x minutes (default 5 minutes) if any of the target streamers is live if they are then a browser window will be opened with their stream running now the program will enter a sleep sleep state for as long as you have set it to sleep (basicly until drop is recieved) then it will close the browser and wait until another stream is found and goes onto that. If all streamers in list have been passed it enters complete state and does nothing.
